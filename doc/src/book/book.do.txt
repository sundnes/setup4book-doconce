__Remark.__
Documents that contain raw Mako code in verbatim code blocks cannot
also be processed by Mako, and this is the case with the `mako`
chapter. Since we need Mako for processing the rest of this book
document, we are forced to compile the `mako` chapter as a stand-alone
document (with the `--no_mako` option) and let this appendix be just a
link to the "this stand-alone document":
% if FORMAT in ('latex', 'pdflatex'):
"http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/mako/pdf/main_mako.pdf".
% else:
"http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/mako/html/index.html".
% endif
