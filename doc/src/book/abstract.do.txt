The goal of this book is to teach graduate students and scientists how to build and solve computational
models of heart mechanics. The book provides the required background knowledge in physiology, continuum mechanics,
and numerical methods, is written in a compact tutorial style, and aims to enable readers to quickly
build and experiment with their own models. After a brief introduction to heart anatomy and physiology, the
book introduces non-linear solid mechanics as the mathematical and computational framework, and continues to
introduce specific topics of heart modeling through a series of illustrating examples. Key topics include 
constitutive laws for hyperelasticity, modeling anisotropy and heterogeneous tissue architecture, modeling 
active contraction, coupling active contraction with passive material behavior, and realistic boundary
conditions for modeling the beating heart. The examples are accompanied by compact and extendable software 
tools written in Python.
