========= Boundary conditions and whole heart models (20-30 p) =========
In the interest of saving space, this should probably not cover whole heart models, but rather a simplified LV model. This choice will allow the description of most of the general features and challenges of whole heart models, without including too much detail. Possible contents will include:
======= The cardiac cycle revisited =======

  * Recapture the phases of the cardiac cycle introduced in Chapter ref{chap1}, and describe how these are connected to valvular events and the mechanics of the circulatory system.

  * Introduce the concept of ventricular BCs by considering passive filling with a prescribed pressure




======= Models for the circulatory system =======

  * Introduce a simple closed loop model for the hemodynamic boundary conditions,

  * Comment on limitations and possible extensions of the simple model, but refer to other sources for actual models



======= Computational models of the beating heart =======

  * Comment on implications for solution methods, and present extensions of previously derived methods to describe the full dynamic problem

  * Examples of interesting simulation cases

  * Possible discussion of limitations and possible extensions

  * Biventricular models, either discussed as a possible extension or included in the form of a simple example
