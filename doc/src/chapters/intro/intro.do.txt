In this chapter we provide a brief introduction to heart anatomy and physiology, 
to serve both as motivation and background material for the computational models
presented in subsequent chapters. The description is intentionally kept brief, 
only introducing the key concepts required to understand the mathematical models. 
For a more detailed and complete overview of heart physiology, the reader is 
referred to a text book in the field, for instance cite{Katz}.

======= Structure of the heart and cardiac muscle =======
===== Heart anatomy and mechanical function =====
The heart is a mechanical pump, which serves the single purpose of pumping blood
through the body. The pumping is achieved by a rhythmic, synchronized contraction 
of the heart muscle, and represents a tremendous physical effort as well as a fine-tuned 
interplay of mechanical, electrophysiological and neuro-hormonal factors. 
The heart is made up of four chambers, illustrated in Figure (xxx). The right and left ventricles
constitute the main pumping chambers of the heart, while the two atria serve as primer
pumps that improve the filling and thereby the pumping efficiency of the ventricles. 
An illustration of the cardiovascular system is shown in Figure xxx. Oxygen-poor blood 
from the vena cava enters 
the right atrium, then flows through the tricuspid valves into the right atrium, and is 
pumped via the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation. After 
passing through the lungs, the now oxygen-rich blood flows returns to the heart via the
pulmonary veins, enters the left atrium, and 
further into the left ventricle via the mitral valve. From the left ventricle the blood flows
through the aortic valve into the aorta, and after several generations of branching vessels
reaches the capillaries, where oxygen and nutrients are transferred to the tissues, and 
flows through the venous system to eventually reach the vena cava and complete the cycle.

The pulmonary circulation (lungs) is a low-resistance system that operates under low pressure,
while a much higher pressure is required to drive the flow through the higher resistance 
of the systemic circulation. The anatomy of the heart reflects this difference in blood pressure,
with the left ventricle being thick-walled with a nearly circular cross section, and the more 
thin-walled right ventricle wrapped around it, see Figure (xxx). 

===== Structure of cardiac muscle tissue =====
label{ch1:tissue_struct}
From a mechanical viewpoint, the heart tissue has two main constituents; the cardiomyocytes
and the extracellular matrix. The cardiomyocytes make up about xx\% of cardiac tissue,
and are the muscle cells responsible for active contraction and performing work. The myocytes 
are roughly cylindrical in shape, with a length of about 100$\mu$m and diameter 10$\mu$m. They 
have a distinct orientation, which makes both the passive and active mechanical properties of
the heart tissue highly anisotropic. The muscle cells line up end-to-end to form a fibrous tissue
structure, although there are no long muscle fibers as seen in skeletal muscle. The orientation of 
the myocytes varies through the heart, as illustrated in Figure (xxx) for the left and right 
ventricle. The orientation is roughly helical, with the myocytes being aligned with the 
endocardial (inner) and epicardial (outer) surfaces, and forming an angle $\alpha$ with the 
horizontal plane. The angle varies approximately linearly from an endocardial value $\alpha_{endo}$ 
to the epicardial value $\alpha_{epi}$, with typical values for human 


and are held together and supported by the extracellular matrix. The matrix is 
primarily made up of collagen, and contributes substantially to the passive mechanical properties
of the tissue. 

The pumping function of the heart is caused by the cyclic stretching and shortening of
the myocytes, which in turn is driven by mechano-chemical processes in tiny sub-cellular
structures called sarcomeres. In physical modeling terminology, the mechanics of the heart is 
truly a multiscale phenomenon. Each sarcomere is approximately xxx $\mu$m long and has a diameter
of around $\mu$m, and they are connected end-to-end into myofibrils, which are bundled together and
fill most of the internal volume of the cardiac myocytes, as illustrated in Figure xxx. 

Moving further down in physical scales, the sarcomeres are made up of overlapping thick and 
thin filaments, see Figure xxx. The thick filaments are made up of the protein xxx

======= The mechanics of heart contraction =======
label{ch1:mech_contr}

Brief overview of the pumping function of the heart viewed as a
mechanical multi-scale problem. A top-down view may be most
illustrative, linking the different phases of the heart cycle
(PV-loop, Wiggers diagram) to the mechanics of the tissue, the
myocyte, and the sub-cellular structures. 




======= Computational mechanics challenges =======
From a viewpoint of computational mechanics, outline the most
important challenges of modeling heart mechanics. 

===== Computational challenges of multiscale problems =====
As outlined above, the pumping of the heart is a multiscale physical phenomenon, 
where the macroscale function is directly linked to processes occuring on scales of
$\mu$m or even nanometers. Defining models of such processes that are suitable for
solving on a computer is highly non-trivial, as it involves capturing the essential 
features on one scale that are transfered to the scale above, without fully resolving
the finer scales. For instance, while it may be possible to build a detailed model of
of the protein interactions in a single sarcomere, there are thousands of sarcomeres
in each myocyte, and up to 10 billion myocytes in a human heart. Resolving the fine details
of each individual sarcomere in a computational model is obviously neither possible nor 
desirable, as the function of a single sarcomere, or even a few myocytes, 
will have no impact on the organ-scale pumping function. Rather, we are interested 
in building models that capture the essential details of the cellular and sub-cellular
mechanisms, and how they are coupled to function and feedback mechanisms on the larger scales.

To model the effects of micro-scale details on larger scales we will apply a 
homogenization procedure, which is in principle similar to the approach used in 
continuum mechanics in order to view fluids and solids as continuous media rather than 
a large number of individual molecules. We will apply the same principle to view the 
cardiac tissue as a continuum, neglecting the discrete, cell-based nature of the tissue.
Physical quantities will be represented as continuous fields, and the net effect of 
micro-scale physical processes will also be represented in this way. For instance, 
a continuous field variable may represent the force developed by the sarcomeres, an 
approximation which hides the fine-scale details but allows (...). 

Although the continuum approach to multiscale modeling is a considerable simplification 
compared with modeling each individual sarcomere or cell, 


models of the pumping heart are true multiscale models, 
Referring to the outline of heart mechanics as a multiscale problem in
Section ref{ch1:mech_contr}, outline current modeling paradigm and
the general computational challenges related to solving multiscale,
multiphysics problems. 

===== Mechanics of soft tissues =====

Outline classical aspects known to be challenging in continuum
mechanics, and describe how they are present in models of passive
muscle tissue:

  * large deformations

  * Non-linear material behavior

  * Incompressibility and related numerical problems

  * High anisotropy

  * Uncertainty and variability in material parameters





======= Heart disease and mechanical dysfunction =======

Some re-organization is possible here, maybe placing this part before
the outline of the mechanical problem. 


  * Brief summary of heart disease in general

  * Outline selected heart problems where mechanical dysfunction of the   heart muscle is an important factor. Of course, the distinction is   not entire clear, but this would exclude severe arrhytmia and direct   effects of valve   dysfunction, but include heart failure and remodeling driven by load imbalance   caused by electrical dyssynchrony or valve problems.





======= Outline and scope of the book =======

Should possibly (probably) be moved to a preface. Outline the book's
content, focus and intended audience, and, most importantly, list the
many important topics that will not be covered by the book.
