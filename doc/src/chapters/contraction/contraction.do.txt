In terms of limiting the scope, this may be the most difficult chapter.  Clearly, covering all aspects of cell mechano-biology is not possible. My first thoughts are to ignore all electrophysiology, and carefully outline the scope and limitations at the start of the chapter. Then something like this: 

======= Cardiomyocyte force development =======

  * Expand on the general introduction given in Chapter ref{ch:intro} , to give a more detailed desription of how myocytes develop force.

  * Describe important features that should be captured by a realistic model, including the cooperativity of the force-Ca relation, and the force-length and force-velocity relations. Focus on biophysical details and modelign issues, and briefly mention computational and numerical difficulties arising from these aspects.

  * Present a model for force-development based on a cross bridge distortion model, in a relatively simple form, and illustrate how the model captures the features listed above.

  * Possibly include a phenomenological model, i.e. based on the ideas introduced by the HMT model, as a model of substantially simplified computational complexity.



======= Cell to tissue coupling =======

  * Describe coupling of single cell contraction to tissue mechanics, in terms of the standard active stress approach

  * Possibly mention the active strain and hybrid approaches as alternatives to the standard form.

  * Comment on computational and biophysical aspects of the two approaches



======= Computational models of active mechanics =======

  * Expand the computational models introduced in Chapter ref{ch:comp_mech}, to include the actively contracting muscle.

  * Illustrate the challenges of strongly coupled simulations, and discuss suitable computational techniques.


During the heart beat an electrical pulse propagates through the heart wall, and the excitation of the muscle cells will in turn trigger the contraction of the muscle. The development of stresses due to the electrical activity is referred to as *active stresses*. When modeling the mechanical behavior of the heart, the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is typically written as the sum of a passive and an active part,

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{\mathcal{S}} = \mathbf{\mathcal{S}}^p +\mathbf{\mathcal{S}}^a.
\end{equation*}
!et
The passive stress $\mathbf{\mathcal{S}}^p$ is related to the mechanical behavior of the cardiac tissue itself, and has been dealt with in previous sections of this report. Now, we consider the active stress tensor $\mathbf{\mathcal{S}}^a$.

The active Cauchy stress tensor, referred to local fiber coordinates, is commonly expressed as cite{usyk_mcculloch2003}

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:active_cauchy}
\mathbf{\sigma}^a = \left (
\begin{array}{ccc}
{\sigma}_{ff}^a & 0 & 0 \\
0 & {\sigma}_{ss}^a & 0 \\
0 & 0 & {\sigma}_{nn}^a
\end{array} \right ),
\end{equation}
!et
 
where $\sigma_{ff}^a$, $\sigma_{ss}^a$, and $\sigma_{nn}^a$ are the active normal stresses in the fiber ($f$), the fiber sheet ($s$), and the fiber sheet normal ($n$) directions, respectively. The active shear stresses are assumed to be zero. Furthermore, the local active Cauchy stress tensor is related to the local active second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor through

!bt
\begin{equation*}
label{eq:PK2}
\mathbf{\mathcal{S}}^a = J\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^{-1}\mathbf{\sigma}^a\mathbf{\mathcal{F}}^{-T}.
\end{equation*}
!et 
Local contributions are expressed in global coordinates using transformation matrices, see Section xxx.

Because of the lack of suitable experimental models for estimating the transverse active normal stresses in (ref{eq:active_cauchy}), a frequently applied simplification is setting these components equal to zero. In this way the only non-zero component in the active Cauchy stress tensor is the fiber normal stress $\sigma_{ff}^a$. 
# However, a constitutive law for the cardiac tissue, which also includes a multi-axial model for actively contracting myocardium, has been established  by Lin and Yin cite{lin_yin1998}. Moreover, a tri-axial active stress model, where the transverse stress components are described as functions of the axial stress $\sigma_{ff}^a$ and local transverse and axial strains, has been employed in the work by Usyk et al. cite{usyk_orthotropic2000} and Mazhari et al. cite{mazhari1999}. 
However, Lin and Yin cite{lin_yin1998} showed that the forces generated in the transverse directions are in the range of 20-60% of active fiber tension in rabbit myocardium. Also, in recent studies the transverse active stress components $\sigma_{ss}^a$ and $\sigma_{nn}^a$ have been included as a function of $\sigma_{ff}^a$ and local transverse and axial strains, to be consistent with biaxial experimental tests cite{usyk_mcculloch2003,usyk_orthotropic2000,mazhari1999}. Hence, the modeling for the actively contracting myocardium should contain contributions from all (local) diagonal components. 


Several active fiber normal stress models of different complexity have been developed over the years, see, e.g., cite{sachse2004,bovendeerd1990,guccione1993} and references therein. In this report we give two examples; a simple linear model cite{linge2005}, and the advanced Hunter-McCulloch-terKeurs (HMT) model cite{hunter1998}.   

=== The HMT Model ===
label{sec:HMT}

According to Sachse cite{sachse2004} the HMT model is one of the most advanced models for active force development.
# , where the active stress is a function of the intracellular calcium concentration Ca and the local fiber stretch value $\lambda$. 
# \obs{Sjekk dette mot HMT-artikkelen!}
The HMT model includes i) the intracellular calcium concentration Ca, ii) the rapid binding of Ca  to troponin C and its slower tension-dependent release, iii) the kinetics of tropomyosin movement and availability of cross-bridge binding sites, and the length-dependence of this process, and iv) the kinetics of cross-bridge tension development under perturbations of myofilament length. In the following, we describe the main parts of the HMT model. 
# Cardiac tissue models for the passive material behavior are described in Section ref{sec:material_models}.

# __Intracellular Ca-consecration__
#  label{sec:HMT_model}
The intracellular calcium concentration is contained in models for describing muscle cell electrophysiology, such as the Beeler-Reuter model cite{beeler_reuter1977}, the Luo-Rudy model cite{luo_rudy1994} and the model by Winslow et al. cite{winslow1999}. In these cell models the uptake to and from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is an important contribution to the total amount of Ca, is taken into account. The intracellular calcium concentration may alternatively be established from experiments, and a convenient representation of the time-dependent intracellular Ca  twitch transient is cite{hunter1998}

!bt
\begin{equation*}
label{eq:Ca_i}
Ca_i(t) = Ca_o + (Ca_{max} - Ca_o) \frac{t}{\tau_{Ca}}e^{1-t/\tau_{Ca}},
\end{equation*}
!et
where $Ca_i(t)$ is the concentration of Ca. The resting level is denoted $Ca_o$, and the maximum value $Ca_{max}$ is achieved at time $t= \tau_{Ca}$. 
# The calcium transient is shown in Figure ref{fig:Ca_consentration}. 
This time-dependent function for the intracellular calcium concentration is close to the measurements obtained by Stuyvers et al. cite{stuyvers1998} for rat trabeculae. 
# The release and uptake of Ca  from and to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and any diffusional gradients of Ca  within the myoplasm is ignored in this model. 
Note that the concentration of intracellular calcium in this model does not vary in space.

The binding and release of Ca to troponin C (TnC) is very fast, and it is believed to be limited by diffusion gradients from the junctional SR release site to the TnC binding site. It also depends on the mechanical state of the muscle. An isotonic twitch terminates much quicker than an isometric twitch, and if the muscle is subjected to a quick release during the twitch, the ability to generate forces is reduced rapidly. These latter phenomena are explained by the release of Ca from TnC. The release and binding of Ca to TnC has been studied for both skeletal and cardiac muscles cite{bremel_weber1972,hoffman_fuchs1987a,hoffman_fuchs1987b,allen_kentish1988,janssen_hunter1995,allen_kurihara1982,peterson1991}. To model the Ca-TnC binding kinetics, the following equation is proposed cite{hunter1998},

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:Cab}
\frac{dCa_b}{dt} = \varrho_0Ca_i(Ca_{bmax}-Ca_b) - \varrho_1\left (1-\frac{\sigma_{ff}^a}{\vartheta \sigma_{o}^a} \right )Ca_b,
\end{equation}
!et
where $Ca_i$ is the concentration of free myoplasmic Ca, and $Ca_b$ is the concentration of Ca bound to the calcium specific binding site on TnC. Moreover, $Ca_{bmax}$ is the maximum value of $Ca_b$ attained at equilibrium when $\sigma_{ff}^a=\vartheta \sigma_{o}^a$, where $\vartheta$ is a scalar parameter value, and $\sigma_{o}^a$ is the isometric fiber normal stress. Attachment is governed by the rate constant $\varrho_0$, and detachment at zero active stress is governed by the rate constant $\varrho_1$. 
# Figure ref{fig:CaTnC}a) shows the ratio between calcium bound to troponin C and the intracellular free calcium concentration Ca.
# The binding of calcium to troponin C as a function of time is shown in Figure ref{fig:CaTnC}b). 
Parameter values for the quantities in (ref{eq:Cab}) are estimated from experiments by Hofman and Fuchs cite{hoffman_fuchs1987a,hoffman_fuchs1987b}.


# === Available Proportion of Available Actin Sites ===

The binding of Ca to TnC initiates changes of the configuration of the thin filaments. This allows cross-bridges to be formed between the thin and thick filaments, i.e. the myosin head binding to the actin, resulting in development of forces cite{fung,holmes1995}. The tropomyosin kinetics is modeled by cite{hunter1998}

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:z}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \alpha_0\left [\left(\frac{Ca_b}{C_{50}}\right )^n(1-z)-z \right ].
\end{equation}
!et
Here, $z$ is a non-dimensional parameter ($0\leq z \leq 1$) representing the proportion of actin sites available for cross-bridge binding. Moreover, $\alpha_0$ is the rate constant of ``tropomyosin movement'', and $C_{50}$ and $n$ are the Hill parameters cite{hunter1998}. 

Under steady state conditions the proportion of actin sites available for cross-bridge binding is found by requiring that $dz/dt=0$ in (ref{eq:z}). This results in the relation

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:z_ss}
z_{SS} = \frac{(Ca_b)^n}{(Ca_b)^n + (C_{50})^n}.
\end{equation}
!et
 
Hofman and Fuchs cite{hoffman_fuchs1987a,hoffman_fuchs1987b} reported direct evidence that length-dependent effects on Ca binding to TnC are mediated via cross-bridge attachments. Under isometric conditions the tension-length relation may be shown to be dependent of calcium through the algebraic relation cite{hunter1998}

!bt
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_o^a(\lambda,z) = \sigma_{ref}^a(1+\beta_0(\lambda-1))z,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $z$ is obtained from solving (ref{eq:z}), or, in case of a steady state situation, from (ref{eq:z_ss}). Moreover, $\sigma_{ref}^a$ is the reference stress at $\lambda=1.0$, whereas $\beta_0=1/\sigma_{ref}^a\cdot d\sigma_o^a/d\lambda$. 

Experiments done by Kentish et al. cite{kentish1986} clearly indicate that the Hill parameters in (ref{eq:z}) (and (ref{eq:z_ss})) must be length-dependent. Hunter et al. cite{hunter1998} found that a linear length-dependence is sufficient to model the full range of the isometric active stresses, i.e.

!bt
\begin{equation*}
label{eq:hill_n}
n = n_{ref}(1+\beta_1(\lambda-1))
\end{equation*}
!et
and

!bt
\begin{equation*}
pC_{50} = pC_{50ref}(1+\beta_2(\lambda-1)),
\end{equation*}
!et
such that

!bt
\begin{equation*}
label{eq:hill_C50}
C_{50}=10^{6-pC_{50}}.
\end{equation*}
!et
The parameter values of the constants $\sigma_{ref}^a$, $\beta_0$, $n_{ref}$, $\beta_1$, $pC_{50ref}$ and $\beta_2$ are determined by fitting the model results to experimental data obtained by Kentish et al. cite{kentish1986} for skinned rat trabeculae. However, some of the values are anomalously high cite{hunter1998}. The set of parameter values are therefore slightly modified. 


To complete the model, we analyze cross-bridge kinetics,
which is modeled by the so-called *fading memory model* cite{bergel_hunter1979,hunter1995}. Applying this model, the active fiber stress may be written as cite{hunter1998}

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:S_a}
\sigma_{ff}^a(t) = \sigma_o^a \frac{1+aZ}{1-Z}.
\end{equation}
!et
In the above expression $a$ is a constant value. Moreover, the model includes a non-linear function $Z(\sigma^a,\sigma_o^a)$. It can be argued that the following non-linear function $Z$ can be chosen

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:Z}
Z(\sigma^a,\sigma_o^a) = \sum_{i=1}^3 A_i\int_{-\infty}^t e^{-\alpha_i(t-\tau)}\mathring{\lambda}(\tau)d\tau,
\end{equation}
!et 
where $\mathring{\lambda}\equiv d\lambda/dt$, and $A_i$ and $\alpha_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) are parameters determined from experiments cite{hancock1993}. A small time step $\Delta t$ is assumed to produce a small change in $\lambda$. Hence, for each time step, $\mathring{\lambda}_k = \frac{\Delta\lambda_k}{\Delta t_k}$ is assumed to be constant, where $\Delta\lambda_k=\lambda(t-\Delta t)- \lambda(t-2\Delta t)$, i.e. the stretch values at the two previous time steps. The total integral in (ref{eq:Z}) may then be written as the sum

!bt
\begin{equation*}
label{Z_sum}
Z =  Z^0 + Z^1 + Z^2 + ...+ Z^k,
\end{equation*}
!et
where $k$ is the time step number, and

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:Z_increment}
Z^{k} = \frac{\Delta\lambda_k}{\Delta t_k} \sum_{i=1}^3 A_i\int_{t-\Delta t_k}^{t} e^{-\alpha_i(t-\tau)}d\tau = \frac{\Delta\lambda_k}{\Delta t_k} \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{A_i}{\alpha_i}\left(1-e^{-\alpha_i\Delta t_k}\right ).
\end{equation}
!et
In the above expression we have taken into account the possibility of adaptive  
(or non-constant) time stepping. For the hereditary integral we also assume that 
the contribution for $t<0$ is negligible compared to that from $t\geq 0$. This may 
be justified by assuming that the change in sarcomere length $\Delta\lambda$ is 
close, or equal, to zero prior to $t=0$, and by the fading memory assumption.

Figure xxx displays the active normal fiber stress 
in (ref{eq:S_a}) as a function of time for different fiber stretch values $\lambda$. 
Panel xxx of Figure xxx  shows the dynamic state, whereas 
panel xxx displays the steady state situation. The $\lambda$ value is held constant in time.
