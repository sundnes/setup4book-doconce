===== Difference equations must have an initial condition =====

!bblock
 * In mathematics, it is much stressed that a difference equation for
   $x_n$ must have an initial condition $x_0$
 * The initial condition is obvious when programming: otherwise we cannot
   start the program ($x_0$ is needed to compute $x_n$)
 * However: if you forget `x[0] = x0` in the program, you get $x_0=0$
   (because `x = zeroes(N+1)`),
   which (usually) gives unintended results!
