========= Constitutive laws for passive heart tissue (20-30 p) =========
label{chap4}

To limit the scope, and keep the focus on commonly used models, the focus should probably be on hyper-elasticity. Still, some justification of why we disregard visco-elastic effects should probably be included. 

======= Modeling soft tissues =======

  * Brief description of the exponential stress-strain behavior characteristic of soft tissues

  * Simple constitutive laws based on strain components and strain invariants



======= Cardiac microstructure and anisotropy =======
(Possibly split this section in two, one covering standard anisotropic
continuum models, and one focusing on the microstructure and related
models.)


  * Recapture and expand the description of cardiac microstructure   from Chapter ref{ch1:tissue_struct}, and how this affects cardiac   mechanical properties.

  * Describe the necessary expansions of the models above to describe orthotropic and transversely isotropic material behavior, including examples of constitutive laws based on strain components and strain (pseudo-)invariants.

  * Introduce the idea of a local (fiber) coordinate system, and how this enters the strain component based constitutive laws.

  * Similar notes on spatially varying material directions for   invariant-based models.

  * Referring back to the first item above, introduce models that   explicitly describe the cardiac microstructure, and discuss the   fundamental differences from the continuum models.



======= Fitting material parameters =======

The purpose of this section is to give the readers a very brief
introduction to how experiments are used to select the material
parameters, and in particular to illustrate the difficulty and
uncertainty associated with this part of the modeling.

  * Brief review of experimental techniques to characterize passive   material response, i.e. uniaxial and biaxial tests, shear tests   etc. Not intended to be a complete presentation or discussion of   experimental techniques, but discuss the different setups with   respect to their ability to characterize anisotropic behavior.

  * Brief review of material parameters encountered in the   litterature, to illustrate variability

  * Promises and limitations of image based techniques, for patient   specific parameter fitting.



======= Computational techniques for passive muscle tissue =======

Present the necessary extensions of the solution methods from Chapter ref{chap3}, in
order to solve the equations of anisotropic hyeprelastic models with
spatially varying material directions. 



The equations derived above, \eqref{heart_eq:DivFS}-\eqref{heart_eq:T_prescribed}
are completely general, in the sense that tehy apply to all kinds of materials.
As long as the deformation satisfies the assumptions of negligible acceleration
term and body force, it can be described by the equations above. Naturally, 
any deformation will be highly dependent not only on the forces acting 
on the material of study (which is included in the equations above), but also on
the mechanical properties of the material involved. The material properties enter
the equation above through so-called \emph{constitutive laws}, which define
a relation between the stresses and strains in a material. 

The simplest possible stress-strain relation, which is applicable in a wide
range of engineering materials and cases is known as Hookes law. It defines a 
linear relation between stress and strain in a material. In the simple case
of uniaxial stretch, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:hooke}, 
Hookes law can be expressed as
\beq
\sigma = E \epsilon. \label{hooke1}
\eeq
Here $\epsilon = \Delta L/L$ is a measure of strain, $\sigma = F/A$ is stress,
and $E$ is a material parameter known as Youngs modulus. In the more general 
case of 3D deformations, the corresponding relation is Hookes generalized law,
given by
\beq
\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{kl}. \label{hooke2}
\eeq
Since $C_{ijkl}$ has four indices, each running from one to three, this tensor
in general has 81 entries. However, because of known symmetry properties of
this tensor it is possible to reduce this number to 21. Furthermore, for
an isotropic material (the material properties are the same in all directions),
Hookes generalized law can be simplified to depend on include only two independent 
parameters. 

The example of Hookes law was merely included to provide a simplified example
of a stress strain relation, to ease the understanding of more advanced 
constituitive laws. Hookes law assumes linear material behavior, and is
also only applicable for small deformations, and none of these requirements
apply to heart tissue. This necessitates far more complex constitutive laws in 
order to describe the material behavior of the muscle. 

Biological tissues, including muscle tissue, is often modeled 
as \textit{hyperelastic}. By assuming hyperelasticity, one is able to 
introduce a so-called strain energy 
potential function that defines a constitutive law for the material.  

A hyperelastic material is path-independent when undergoing deformations. 
The work done by the stresses during a deformation process depends on the 
initial state and the final deformed state only. Hence, the deformation can 
be expressed by an \textit{elastic potential} or a 
\textit{stored strain energy function} per unit volume, $\Psi$. 
Moreover, the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is expressed 
as the derivative of $\Psi$ with respect to the components of the 
Green-Lagrange strain tensor $\mathbfx{\mathcal{E}}$ 
\cite{heart_holzapfel,heart_bonet_wood},
\beq
\label{heart_eq:S_Psi_E}
\mathbfx{\mathcal{S}}(\mathbfx{\mathcal{E}}, \mathbfx{X}) = {\partial\Psi\over\partial\mathbfx{\mathcal{E}}}
\eeq 
Along with an expression for the path-independence, 
(\ref{heart_eq:S_Psi_E}) is often used as the definition of a hyperelastic 
material \cite{heart_bonet_wood}. 

The elastic properties of the material can be expressed by a fourth-order 
elasticity tensor $\mathbfx{\mathcal{C}}$ (not to be confused with $\mathbfx{C}$ 
above), which depends on the deformation. It is defined as the derivative of the 
second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor with respect to the components of the 
Green-Lagrange strain tensor 
\[
\label{heart_eq:fourth_order_C}
\mathbfx{\mathcal{C}} = {\partial\mathbfx{\mathcal{S}}\over\partial {\mathbfx{\mathcal{E}}}}= {\partial\Psi\over\partial\mathbfx{\mathcal{E}}\partial{\mathbfx{\mathcal{E}}}} = 4{\partial\Psi\over\partial\mathbfx{C}\partial\mathbfx{C}}.
\]
This tensor is similar to the tensor introduced in Hookes generalized law above,
in that it generally has 81 components that can be reduced to 21 because of 
symmetry. The tensor can be interpreted as an instantanous elasticity tensor 
for the material, which characterizes the stress strain relation in a small 
region around the current deformation state.

\subsection{Constitutive Laws for Muscle Tissue}

The material behavior of the heart muscle may be divided in two. First, we have
the passive material behavior, which relates the force to the deformation in 
a relaxed muscle. Second, there is the active contractile force developed by 
the muscle. These two types of material behavior have typically been modeled quite
separately both for skeletal muscle and heart muscle. The passive material
properties are typically described as a non-linearly (hyper)elastic material, 
while the active contraction is modeled as an additional stress term which depends
on the electrical activation state of teh muscle. 
In this section we give
a short introduction to non-linearly elastic constitutive laws in general, and
then describe som of the more influential models for heart muscle behavior, both
passive and active. 

(A more complete overview of cardiac tissue models in particular, may be found in, e.g., \cite{heart_sachse2004}.)




\subsubsection{The ``Pole-Zero'' Cardiac Tissue Model}
A well established material model for cardiac tissue is the so-called ``pole-zero'' model, see, e.g., \cite{heart_nash_hunter2000}. The strain energy function is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi &=&  k_{ff}\frac{\mathcal{E}_{ff}^2}{|a_{ff}-\mathcal{E}_{ff}|^{b_{ff}}} + k_{ss}\frac{\mathcal{E}_{ss}^2}{|a_{ss}-\mathcal{E}_{ss}|^{b_{ss}}} + k_{nn}\frac{\mathcal{E}_{nn}^2}{|a_{nn}-\mathcal{E}_{nn}|^{b_{nn}}} \nonumber \\
&& + k_{fs}\frac{\mathcal{E}_{fs}^2}{|a_{fs}-\mathcal{E}_{fs}|^{b_{fs}}} + k_{fn}\frac{\mathcal{E}_{fn}^2}{|a_{fn}-\mathcal{E}_{fn}|^{b_{fn}}} + k_{sn}\frac{\mathcal{E}_{sn}^2}{|a_{sn}-\mathcal{E}_{sn}|^{b_{sn}}}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Here, ${\mathcal{E}}_{ij}$ are components of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor referred to the local fiber direction ($f$), the fiber sheet direction ($s$), which is normal to the fiber direction, and the fiber normal direction ($n$).
Moreover, $k_{ij}$, $a_{ij}$, and $b_{ij}$ are constitutive parameters referred to the local fiber coordinate system. The values of $a_{ij}$ denotes the limiting strains, or poles. An underlying assumption of this model is that the material has an orthotropic behavior.



\subsubsection{An Exponential Cardiac Tissue Model}
\label{heart_sec:material_model}
A set of alternative constitutive laws for the cardiac tissue are expressed as exponential functions. As an example, we consider a non-linear, transversely isotropic, hyperelastic model, which for an almost incompressible material may be written \cite{heart_usyk_mcculloch2003},
\beq
\label{heart_eq:psi_displacement}
\Psi = \frac{1}{2}K(e^{W}-1) + C_{compr}(J \ln J - J +1),
\eeq
where 
\beq
\label{heart_eq:W_displacement}
W = b_{ff}{\mathcal{E}}_{ff}^2 + b_{xx}({\mathcal{E}}_{nn}^2+{\mathcal{E}}_{ss}^2+{\mathcal{E}}_{sn}^2 +{\mathcal{E}}_{ns}^2) + b_{fx}({\mathcal{E}}_{fn}^2 + {\mathcal{E}}_{nf}^2 + {\mathcal{E}}_{fs}^2 + {\mathcal{E}}_{sf}^2).
\eeq
As for the ``pole-zero'' law, ${\mathcal{E}}_{ij}$ are the components of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor referred to the local fiber ($f$), fiber sheet ($s$), and fiber normal ($n$) axes. Furthermore, $K$, $b_{ff}$, $b_{fx}$, and $b_{xx}$ are material parameters, $J$ is the determinant of the deformation gradient, and $C_{compr}$ represents the empirically observed bulk modulus. The material parameters in (\ref{heart_eq:psi_displacement}) and (\ref{heart_eq:W_displacement}) are typically determined from physical experiments. 

The strain energy function in (\ref{heart_eq:psi_displacement}) can easily be extended to an orthotropic model. In that case (\ref{heart_eq:W_displacement}) is replaced by 
\[
\label{heart_eq:W_displacement_2}
W = b_{ff}{\mathcal{E}}_{ff}^2 +  b_{ss}{\mathcal{E}}_{ss}^2 + b_{nn}{\mathcal{E}}_{nn}^2 + b_{fs}({\mathcal{E}}_{fs}^2+{\mathcal{E}}_{sf}^2) + b_{fn}({\mathcal{E}}_{fn}^2+{\mathcal{E}}_{nf}^2) + b_{ns}({\mathcal{E}}_{ns}^2+{\mathcal{E}}_{sn}^2),
\]
where $b_{ff}$, $b_{ss}$, $b_{nn}$, $b_{fs}$, $b_{fn}$, and $b_{ns}$ are material parameters, and ${\mathcal{E}}_{ij}$ are the components of the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, as before. 
The above models have been used for several applications, see, e.g., \cite{heart_usyk_legrice2002,heart_usyk_orthotropic2000}, and  the transversely isotropic version has been applied as a starting point for deriving a suitable strain energy function to be applied in the mixed formulation briefly presented in this report. Details are found in \cite{heart_thorvaldsen2005}.
