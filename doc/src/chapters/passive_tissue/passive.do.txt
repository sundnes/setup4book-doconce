========= Constitutive laws for passive heart tissue (20-30 p) =========
label{chap4}

To limit the scope, and keep the focus on commonly used models, the focus should probably be on hyper-elasticity. Still, some justification of why we disregard visco-elastic effects should probably be included. 

======= Modeling soft tissues =======

  * Brief description of the exponential stress-strain behavior characteristic of soft tissues

  * Simple constitutive laws based on strain components and strain invariants



======= Cardiac microstructure and anisotropy =======
(Possibly split this section in two, one covering standard anisotropic
continuum models, and one focusing on the microstructure and related
models.)


  * Recapture and expand the description of cardiac microstructure   from Chapter ref{ch1:tissue_struct}, and how this affects cardiac   mechanical properties.

  * Describe the necessary expansions of the models above to describe orthotropic and transversely isotropic material behavior, including examples of constitutive laws based on strain components and strain (pseudo-)invariants.

  * Introduce the idea of a local (fiber) coordinate system, and how this enters the strain component based constitutive laws.

  * Similar notes on spatially varying material directions for   invariant-based models.

  * Referring back to the first item above, introduce models that   explicitly describe the cardiac microstructure, and discuss the   fundamental differences from the continuum models.



======= Fitting material parameters =======

The purpose of this section is to give the readers a very brief
introduction to how experiments are used to select the material
parameters, and in particular to illustrate the difficulty and
uncertainty associated with this part of the modeling.

  * Brief review of experimental techniques to characterize passive   material response, i.e. uniaxial and biaxial tests, shear tests   etc. Not intended to be a complete presentation or discussion of   experimental techniques, but discuss the different setups with   respect to their ability to characterize anisotropic behavior.

  * Brief review of material parameters encountered in the   litterature, to illustrate variability

  * Promises and limitations of image based techniques, for patient   specific parameter fitting.



======= Computational techniques for passive muscle tissue =======

Present the necessary extensions of the solution methods from Chapter ref{chap3}, in
order to solve the equations of anisotropic hyeprelastic models with
spatially varying material directions.
