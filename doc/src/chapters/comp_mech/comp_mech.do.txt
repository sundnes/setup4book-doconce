========= Computational techniques for elasticity (20-30 p) =========
label{chap3}

It may be discussed where this chapter is to be put, but most likely
it is useful to introduce the solution methods before introducing the
more complex constitutive laws. This may give a fairly compact
description, and since the methods have already been introduced, the 
necessary extensions and modifications may be described in 
subsequent chapters.

======= Numerical methods for PDEs =======

Brief, general discussion of numerical methods for PDE problems,
referencing the known challenges outlined earlier. Introduce the
finite element method as the method of choice for spatial
discretization of the mechanics problem. 

======= Outline of the finite element method =======

Brief introduction to the finite element method for PDEs, using the standard
Poisson problem as model equation.

======= FEM for linear and non-linear elasticity =======

  * FEM for linear elasticity (Navier's equation)

  * FEM for non-linear hyperelasticity, derived in the standard   form, but with notes on equivalent concepts such as the principle of   virtual work and principle of stationary potential energy.

  * Linearization techniquez for FE equations arising from   non-linear hyperelasticity

  * Element choices, incompressibility and locking
